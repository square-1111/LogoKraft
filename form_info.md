### **Step 2: Define Your Style (Optional, but Recommended)**

This is the crucial step for visual direction. We present it as a choice. The user can either give us visual input, answer a few simple questions, or skip it entirely.

**How should your logo feel?**
*(Providing this info helps our AI create much more accurate designs for you.)*

### **Step 3: The AI Generation & Refinement**

This is where our powerful AI models get to work.

Based on **all the information provided**, our AI generates a grid of **unique, custom logos**. This is not a static template gallery.

**Here are your custom logo concepts.**

The user sees 10-20 logos generated specifically for them. From here, they can:

1.  **Favorite the ones they like.**
2.  **Click on a logo to enter a simple editor** to make minor tweaks (change color, adjust font, etc.).
3.  **Request variations** of a logo they like ("Show me more like this").

This flow is incredibly simple for the user but provides our powerful AI with a rich, structured prompt to deliver premium, highly relevant results. It respects the user's time while maximizing the creative output.
