Alright, co-founder. Let's get this done.

This is a fantastic plan. The tech stack is modern, scalable, and cost-effective. Python for the backend is perfect for AI integration, Supabase is a powerhouse that will save us massive amounts of time on auth and database management, and Railway makes deployment a breeze.

Here is our comprehensive game plan. We'll break it down into strategy, backend, frontend, and our development workflow.

### Phase 0: The Foundation (The Next 48 Hours)

Before we write a single line of code, we need to set up our workshop.

1.  **Define the MVP (Minimum Viable Product):** Our goal is to get a user from landing page to a downloaded logo as quickly as possible.
    *   **Core Loop:** User signs up/logs in -> Fills out the 3-step brief -> Gets AI-generated logos -> Can make minor edits (color, font) -> Downloads a high-res PNG.
    *   **What we're IGNORING for now:** Team accounts, advanced vector editing, brand kits, billing, social media templates. We can add those later. Focus on the core loop.

2.  **Set Up Our Tools:**
    *   **Code Repository:** Create a new **private GitHub repository**. This is our single source of truth.
    *   **Project Management:** Create a simple Trello or Notion board. We'll have four columns: `Backlog`, `To-Do`, `In Progress`, `Done`. We'll populate it with the tasks from this plan.
    *   **Supabase:** Create **TWO** projects.
        *   `logo-saas-dev`: Our development and testing database.
        *   `logo-saas-prod`: Our live production database. This is critical for not messing up real user data.
    *   **Railway:** Create an account. We won't connect it yet, but have it ready.

### Phase 1: The Backend Plan (The Real-Time Engine)

This is our first priority. The frontend can't do much without an API to talk to. We'll use **FastAPI** as our Python framework because it's incredibly fast, modern, and has built-in SSE support.

**Required Services/Components:**

1.  **API Framework Setup (FastAPI):**
    *   Set up a new FastAPI project.
    *   Structure it with separate folders for routes, models (Pydantic), and services.

2.  **Database Schema (The Future-Proof Model):**
    *   `users`: Supabase Auth handles this for us. Beautiful.
    *   `brand_projects`:
        *   `id` (uuid, primary key)
        *   `user_id` (foreign key to `auth.users`)
        *   `project_name` (text)
        *   `brief_data` (jsonb): The full brief the user submitted.
        *   `inspiration_image_url` (text, nullable): URL to the user's uploaded inspiration image.
    *   `generated_assets`:
        *   `id` (uuid, primary key)
        *   `project_id` (foreign key to `brand_projects`)
        *   `parent_asset_id` (uuid, foreign key to `generated_assets.id`, nullable): Crucial for tracking edits and variations.
        *   `asset_type` (text): 'logo_concept', 'mockup_tshirt', etc.
        *   `status` (text): 'pending', 'generating', 'completed', 'failed'.
        *   `asset_url` (text, nullable): Link to the generated image in Supabase Storage.
        *   `generation_prompt` (text): The exact prompt sent to the image model. Critical for debugging and refinement.

3.  **User Authentication:**
    *   Implement Supabase Auth. The Python `supabase-py` library makes this easy. Our API endpoints will require a valid JWT from the user.

4.  **The AI Orchestrator Service:**
    *   This is our core logic. We'll create an `ai_orchestrator.py`.
    *   When a request comes in to create a project, this service will:
        1.  Create the `brand_project` entry in the database.
        2.  Create multiple `generated_assets` entries, all with `status: 'pending'`.
        3.  Launch a background task for each asset to be generated using FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks`.
    *   Each background task will handle the full generation pipeline.

5.  **Image Storage (Supabase Storage):**
    *   The background tasks will upload generated assets and inspiration images to dedicated Supabase Storage buckets.

6.  **API Endpoints (The Routes - With SSE Support):**
    *   `POST /api/v1/auth/signup`, `POST /api/v1/auth/login`
    *   `POST /api/v1/projects`:
        *   **Request:** The user's brief (JSON data and optional image file).
        *   **Action:** Triggers the AI Orchestrator.
        *   **Response:** `{ "project_id": "...", "stream_url": "/api/v1/projects/{project_id}/stream" }`
    *   **`GET /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/stream` (SSE Endpoint):**
        *   The key real-time endpoint. Holds the connection open.
        *   When an asset's status changes to `completed`, yields `data: {"event": "asset_completed", "asset": {...}}`.
        *   Handles failures by sending an `asset_failed` event if an asset's status is updated to `failed`.
        *   Once all initial assets are done, sends `data: {"event": "generation_complete"}` and closes the connection.
    *   `GET /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/assets`:
        *   **Response:** Current state of all assets for that project (for revisiting).
    *   `POST /api/v1/assets/{asset_id}/refine`:
        *   **Function:** Triggers a new AI generation for a variation or edit.

### Phase 2: The Frontend Plan (The Real-Time Experience)

We'll use **Next.js (React)** with **TailwindCSS** for a modern, responsive UI.

**Required Components & Pages:**

1.  **Pages:**
    *   `/` (Landing Page), `/login`, `/signup`
    *   `/create`: The main 3-step brief creation flow.
    *   `/project/{project_id}`: The "Generation & Dashboard" page where assets stream in and are permanently stored.
    *   `/dashboard`: Gallery of all user projects.

2.  **Core Components:**
    *   `BriefForm.js`, `StyleSelector.js`, `ProjectView.js`, `Editor.js`, `AssetCard.js` (to display individual assets with loading/completed/failed states).

3.  **State Management:**
    *   We'll use **Zustand** for simple, powerful global state management.

4.  **API Integration (With SSE Support):**
    *   Use a dedicated `apiClient.js` for REST requests and `streamClient.js` for SSE.
    *   The `streamClient` will use the browser's `EventSource` API.
    *   The event listener will handle multiple event types to update the UI in real-time:
        ```javascript
        const eventSource = new EventSource(streamUrl);
        eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
            const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
            if (data.event === 'asset_completed') {
                updateAssetInStore(data.asset);
            } else if (data.event === 'asset_failed') {
                showErrorStateForAsset(data.asset_id, data.error_message);
            } else if (data.event === 'generation_complete') {
                eventSource.close();
            }
        };
        ```

---

### Phase 3: The Dev vs. Prod Workflow (How We Work)

This is our professional development process.

*   **Git Strategy:** `main` for production, `develop` for staging, `feature/*` for all new work. No direct pushes to `main` or `develop`. All merges via Pull Requests.
*   **Environments:** Railway deploys the `main` branch to our production URL and the `develop` branch to a staging URL. Each environment connects to its corresponding Supabase project (`prod` or `dev`) using environment variables.

### Next Immediate Steps (Updated for SSE Architecture)

1.  **You:** Set up the GitHub repo, the two Supabase projects, and the Trello board. Invite me.
2.  **Me (as your co-founder):** I'll populate the Trello board with detailed tasks based on these aligned plans.
3.  **You:** Start working on the Backend. Create the FastAPI project. Your first critical goals:
    *   Get the `brand_projects` and `generated_assets` tables created in the `logo-saas-dev` Supabase project with the correct schema.
    *   Implement the `GET /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/stream` SSE endpoint and test it by streaming dummy messages.
