Of course. This is exactly what a co-founder should be doingâ€”drilling down into the details to make the abstract plan a concrete engineering blueprint.

Let's do this. We'll break down the entire backend into a highly granular, step-by-step plan. This is our roadmap.

### Phase 1: The Foundation - Database & Setup (Granular)

This is the concrete slab our entire application will be built on.

1.  **Tooling:**
    *   **Language/Framework:** Python 3.11+ with FastAPI.
    *   **Database Client:** `supabase-py` for interacting with Supabase.
    *   **AI Clients:** `google-generativeai` for Gemini, `requests` or a dedicated client for our image models.

2.  **Supabase Setup:**
    *   **Tables:** We will use the Supabase web interface to create these tables in our `dev` project.
        *   `brand_projects`:
            *   `id` (uuid, primary key)
            *   `user_id` (uuid, foreign key to `auth.users`)
            *   `project_name` (text)
            *   `brief_data` (jsonb) - Stores the raw user input (keywords, industry, etc.).
            *   `inspiration_image_url` (text, nullable) - **This is where we'll store the URL of the uploaded inspiration image.**
        *   `generated_assets`:
            *   `id` (uuid, primary key)
            *   `project_id` (uuid, foreign key to `brand_projects`)
            *   `parent_asset_id` (uuid, foreign key to `generated_assets.id`, nullable) - **Crucial for edits/variations.**
            *   `asset_type` (text) - e.g., `logo_concept`, `mockup_business_card`.
            *   `status` (text) - `pending`, `generating`, `completed`, `failed`.
            *   `asset_url` (text, nullable) - The final URL in our storage.
            *   `generation_prompt` (text) - **The exact prompt generated by Gemini and sent to the image model.** Storing this is critical for debugging and refinement.
    *   **Storage Buckets:**
        *   `inspiration-images`: Bucket to hold user uploads.
        *   `generated-assets`: Bucket to hold the final AI-generated images.
    *   **Security:** Enable **Row Level Security (RLS)** on all tables from day one. Write policies that ensure a user can only see and edit their own `brand_projects` and `generated_assets`.

### Phase 2: The Core Generation Workflow (Granular End-to-End)

This is the detailed, step-by-step data flow for a new logo project.

**Step 1: The API Request (Frontend to Backend)**
*   The frontend will send a `multipart/form-data` request to `POST /api/v1/projects`.
*   This request will contain two parts: `brief_data` (JSON string) and an optional `inspiration_file` (image file).

**Step 2: The Controller (`routes/project_routes.py`)**
*   The endpoint receives the request.
*   It creates a new `brand_projects` entry.
*   If `inspiration_file` exists, it uploads it to the `inspiration-images` bucket and updates the `brand_projects` entry with the URL.
*   It calls our `OrchestratorService` to begin the real work, passing it the `project_id`.
*   It immediately returns the `project_id` and `stream_url` to the frontend.

**Step 3: The Prompt Engineering Service (`services/gemini_service.py`)**
*   The Orchestrator calls this service first.
*   It has one main function: `create_prompts_from_brief(brief_data, inspiration_url)`.
*   This function constructs a detailed meta-prompt for Gemini 2.5 Pro, calls the API via the `google-genai` library, and returns a JSON array of high-quality image prompts.

**Step 4: The AI Orchestrator (`services/orchestrator_service.py`)**
*   It receives the prompts from the Gemini service.
*   For each prompt, it creates a `generated_assets` entry with `status: 'pending'` and spawns a separate `BackgroundTasks` instance to handle the image generation.

**Step 5: The Image Generation Service (`services/image_generation_service.py`)**
*   *(Note: We use a generic name here because this service will orchestrate calls to **both** Seedream for initial generation and Nano Banana for edits, as per our strategy.)*
*   This service is called by the background tasks. It has a function: `generate_image(prompt, asset_id)`.
*   This function:
    1.  Updates the asset's status in the DB to `generating`.
    2.  Calls the appropriate image model API (e.g., Seedream).
    3.  On success, uploads the image to the `generated-assets` bucket and updates the asset's status to `completed` with the new `asset_url`.
    4.  On failure, updates the asset's status to `failed`.

**Step 6: The SSE Stream (`routes/project_routes.py`)**
*   While this is happening, the frontend is connected to our `GET /.../stream` endpoint.
*   This endpoint loops, checking the `generated_assets` table for that `project_id`.
*   When it sees a status change to `completed` or `failed`, it grabs that row's data and `yields` it to the frontend as a JSON message (`asset_completed` or `asset_failed`).

---

### Phase 3: The Editing Workflow

**Step 1: The API Request**
*   The user initiates an edit (e.g., "variation").
*   The frontend sends a request to `POST /api/v1/assets/{asset_id}/refine` with the action details.

**Step 2: The Refinement Logic**
*   The backend fetches the original asset to get its prompt and image URL.
*   It uses the Gemini service to create a new, refined prompt.
*   It sends this new prompt and the original image URL to our **Nano Banana image-to-image editing endpoint** via the `image_generation_service`.
*   A new asset is generated, uploaded, and a **new row is created** in `generated_assets`, with its `parent_asset_id` pointing to the original logo. The SSE stream pushes this new "child" asset to the UI.
