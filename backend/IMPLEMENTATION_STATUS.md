## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Milestone 3)

### Priority Order for AI Integration:

1. **Create Gemini Service** (`app/services/gemini_service.py`)
   - Prompt generation from project briefs
   - Integration with Gemini 2.5 Pro API
   - High-quality image prompt creation

2. **Create Image Generation Service** (`app/services/image_generation_service.py`)
   - Seedream API integration
   - Image generation from prompts
   - Upload to generated-assets bucket

3. **Create Orchestrator Service** (`app/services/orchestrator_service.py`)
   - Background task coordination
   - Asset status management
   - Integration with existing SSE streaming

4. **Wire AI into Project Routes**

## üìä Test Results Summary

**All endpoints tested on 2025-09-23:**

| Endpoint | Method | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| `/health` | GET | ‚úÖ PASS | Database healthy |
| `/api/v1/auth/signup` | POST | ‚úÖ PASS | User creation working |
| `/api/v1/auth/login` | POST | ‚úÖ PASS | JWT tokens returned |
| `/api/v1/projects` | POST | ‚úÖ PASS | Project creation & file upload |
| `/api/v1/projects/{id}` | GET | ‚úÖ PASS | Project retrieval with auth |
| `/api/v1/projects/{id}/stream` | GET | ‚úÖ PASS | SSE streaming active |

**Issues Fixed:**
- ‚úÖ Made `access_token` optional for signup (email confirmation)
- ‚úÖ Removed non-existent `status` column from project schema
- ‚úÖ Updated models to match actual database structure

**Ready for Production:** Milestone 2 foundation is stable and production-ready.
