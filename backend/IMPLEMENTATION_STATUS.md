# LogoKraft Backend Implementation Status

## ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETE)
- [x] Python 3.11+ with FastAPI setup
- [x] Supabase integration with supabase-py
- [x] Google Generative AI client installed
- [x] Database tables created:
  - [x] `brand_projects` with all required fields
  - [x] `generated_assets` with parent_asset_id for variations
- [x] Storage buckets configured:
  - [x] `inspiration-images` for uploads
  - [x] `generated-assets` for AI output
- [x] Row Level Security (RLS) enabled with user-scoped policies
- [x] Environment configuration with proper secrets management

## ⏳ Phase 2: Core Generation Workflow (TODO)

### Required Files to Create:

#### 1. `app/routes/project_routes.py`
- [ ] POST /api/v1/projects endpoint
- [ ] Handle multipart/form-data
- [ ] Create brand_projects entry
- [ ] Upload inspiration images to storage
- [ ] Return project_id and stream_url

#### 2. `app/services/gemini_service.py`
- [ ] `create_prompts_from_brief()` function
- [ ] Integrate with Gemini 2.5 Pro
- [ ] Generate high-quality image prompts

#### 3. `app/services/orchestrator_service.py`
- [ ] Coordinate prompt generation
- [ ] Manage background tasks
- [ ] Create generated_assets entries

#### 4. `app/services/image_generation_service.py`
- [ ] `generate_image()` function
- [ ] Seedream API integration
- [ ] Upload to generated-assets bucket
- [ ] Update asset status

#### 5. SSE Stream in `project_routes.py`
- [ ] GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/stream endpoint
- [ ] Real-time status updates
- [ ] Yield completed/failed assets

## ⏳ Phase 3: Editing Workflow (TODO)

#### 1. Edit Endpoint
- [ ] POST /api/v1/assets/{asset_id}/refine
- [ ] Handle variation requests

#### 2. Refinement Service
- [ ] Fetch original asset
- [ ] Generate refined prompts
- [ ] Nano Banana image-to-image API
- [ ] Link with parent_asset_id

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priority**: Implement Phase 2 Core Generation Workflow
   - Start with project_routes.py
   - Then services in order: gemini → orchestrator → image_generation

2. **API Keys Needed**:
   - [ ] Seedream API key (add to .env)
   - [ ] Nano Banana API key (add to .env)

3. **Testing**:
   - [ ] Create test endpoints
   - [ ] Add pytest fixtures
   - [ ] Mock external APIs for testing

## 🔗 Dependencies
- All database schema: ✅ Ready
- FastAPI structure: ✅ Ready  
- Environment config: ✅ Ready
- External API keys: ⏳ Needed
