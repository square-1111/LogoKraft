## Phase 1: Core Refinement System Foundation
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Must complete before any other phases
**Dependencies**: None - can start immediately

### Sub-Phase 1A: Code Cleanup (Days 1-2)

**Immediate Actions - Today:**
- Remove complex refinement service files:
  - `app/services/chat_iteration_service.py`
  - `app/services/refinement_service.py`
  - `test_chat_iteration.py` 
  - `test_refinement_system.py`

- Clean up project routes:
  - Remove complex refinement endpoints from `project_routes.py`
  - Remove chat iteration endpoints
  - Keep core project management endpoints

- Update schemas:
  - Remove chat-related models from `schemas.py`
  - Remove complex refinement request/response models
  - Keep core project and asset models

**Verification Steps:**
- Test that existing SSE streaming still works
- Verify core logo generation (15 logos) remains functional
- Confirm credit system operates correctly

### Sub-Phase 1B: Simple Refinement Service (Days 2-3)

**Core Implementation:**
- Create `app/services/simple_refinement_service.py`
- Implement single refinement logic:
  ```
  Input: 1 selected logo + optional text prompt
  Process: Generate 5 variations using existing image generation
  Output: 5 new logo assets with progress tracking
  ```

**Database Updates:**
- Add simple refinement tracking fields
- Update asset metadata for refinement history
- Maintain credit deduction system (5 credits per refinement)

**API Endpoint Creation:**
- `POST /api/v1/assets/{asset_id}/simple-refine`
- Request: `{"prompt": "make it more modern"}`
- Response: List of 5 new asset IDs

### Sub-Phase 1C: Real-Time Progress Integration (Day 3)

**SSE Implementation:**
- Add refinement progress streaming:
  - `GET /api/v1/assets/{asset_id}/refinement/stream`
  - Events: refinement_started, progress updates, completion

**Progress Tracking:**
```
Refinement Progress Flow:
Starting refinement...        [0%]
Generating variation 1/5...   [20%]
Generating variation 2/5...   [40%]
Generating variation 3/5...   [60%]
Generating variation 4/5...   [80%]
Generating variation 5/5...   [100%]
All variations complete!
```

### Sub-Phase 1D: Integration Testing (Day 4)

**Complete Flow Testing:**
1. Project creation → 15 logos generated
2. Single logo selection
3. Optional prompt entry
4. 5 variations generated with real-time progress
5. Credit deduction verification

**Success Criteria Phase 1:**
- Users can select 1 logo and refine it with optional prompt
- 5 variations generated within 30 seconds
- Real-time progress updates via SSE
- Credit system functions correctly
- All existing functionality preserved
